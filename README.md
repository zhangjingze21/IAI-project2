# Project 2: Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch

</div>

You can run the code by modifing the config files in the `config` directory to run different experiments.

Example:

```
python src/train.py logger.wandb.name=xxx  
```

This will run the training script with the specified wandb name.

Config can be modified in the `config` directory to change the hyperparameters, data, and model. And the `src` directory contains the implementation of the neural network and dataloader.

You can find the result of the experiments in the https://wandb.ai/ via the following links: https://wandb.ai/zhangjingze21/IAI-project2/

You need to process the dataset before you run my code. And you can also find the dataset via emailing me. My personal email is zhangjingze21@gmail.com
